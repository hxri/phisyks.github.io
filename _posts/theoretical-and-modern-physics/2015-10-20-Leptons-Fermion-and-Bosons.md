summary: Elementary particles are still unseen and we only see their properties by their behavior and results they produce during experiments. But is that all? Are these the smallest of everything in this universe?

# Leptons, Fermions and Bosons
<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">Elementary particles in an atom as we know are <strong>Electrons, Protons and Neutrons</strong>. Each have certain characteristic properties which include <strong>Mass, Charge, Spin, Energy</strong> etc.

</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">Maybe not. Each of the particles are made up of even smaller set of particles called <strong>quarks. </strong>There are 6 varieties of quarks and they too have many characteristic properties. One important similarity between the quarks and those bigger elementary particles is that they obey the <strong>Pauli Exclusion Principle.

        </span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">The ones in <span style="color:red;"><strong>red</strong></span> are <span style="color:red;"><strong>quarks</strong></span>. The one in <span style="color:#00b050;"><strong>green</strong></span> are called <span style="color:#00b050;"><strong>leptons</strong></span>. These are particles having half integer spin. And the ones in <strong>black</strong> are called <strong>gauge boson</strong> which are the cause of forces like Electrostatic and etc. in particles.</span></p>
