#Big Bang and Matter

A long time ago, exactly 13.7 billion years ago there was a point. A point that was everything then and has become everything we see now. Physicists call it the "Singularity".

A point that was infinitely small and has tremendous amount of energy, all ready for the greatest explosion we can ever imagine.

<strong>But the big question is, how can a single point mass create all these huge stars, galaxies and other heavenly bodies in the universe?</strong>

The answer is quite confusing. All these mass we see around were compressed into that point of singularity, held together by huge amounts of energy.

Let's see what happened after the <span style="color:red;"><strong>Big Bang</strong><span style="color:black;">. But remember we still don't know what was there before the Big Bang and what caused it. Below there is a timeline of the processes involved from the beginning to the present condition of the universe.

<span style="color:black;">The next process that occurred was <strong>Quark confinement.</strong> What actually occurred during this process was that the quarks were confined and they can no longer be separated. They exists in groups of 2 or 3 or even 5. To learn more on quarks go to my other post on the category dedicated quantum mechanics.

<span style="color:black;">Now we have reached the stage where we have atoms which can make molecules and further complex substances and everything we see around us.

<span style="color:black;">To explain each of these processes in detail, I'll make a few more posts on the topic.</span>
