#Newton’s laws of motion and Work-Energy theorem#

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">According to Newton's laws of motion, a body behaves in 3d space with respect to 3 basic laws. These are generally called the "Laws of motion". It is a very important concept in mechanics, specifically classical mechanics.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">The three laws of motion as proposed by newton are:
</span></p><p>
 </p><p><span style="font-size:22pt;"><strong>Law 1 – "A body continues to be in its state of rest or motion, unless or until it is compelled by an external force".
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">What it actually means is that a body that is in rest or in motion will never change its state of motion (rest or in motion), until or unless an external force is applied.

		</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;"> This force (external) should be not from the system itself. It should be strictly from outside the system.
</span></p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">
 </p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">
 </p><p><span style="font-size:22pt;"><strong>Law 2 – "The Acceleration on a body depends upon 2 factors: The net force acting on the body and the mass of the body" 
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">This means that the net force, mass and acceleration are dependent on each other for a body in motion by the given equation

		</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">(Where m=mass of body, a= acceleration and F=net force)    
</span></p><p>
 </p><p>
 </p><p><span style="font-size:22pt;"><strong>Law 3 – "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction"
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:14pt;">One of the most famous quotes that unknowingly dictates a very important law in physics.
