Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a

> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
