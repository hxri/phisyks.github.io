**Work Energy theorem**

***
Work-Energy theorem is a very important concept of physics which describes the relation between energy and work done by a body.

Let’s try to understand what actually does this implies.

Consider a body of mass (m) moving along a plane as shown in the diagram with a velocity (v).

Now as the body is in motion it should have some Kinetic energy given by **½mv<sup>2</sup>**
