#Basics of Circular Motion#


What makes something move in a circular path?

_When an object is in circular motion its path is confined to a circle of fixed radius. Let us try to understand the basic laws that govern the motion of such an object._

Consider an object moving in a circular path of **radius** (R), initially at pint P and reaches point Q in time (t), as shown in the image below

_The distance covered by the object during the course of circular motion is measured in terms of the angle that it makes about the center of the circular path from its initial position. This displacement is called **Angular displacement**_.

In the above image the angular displacement is:

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Angular Velocity**</span>

It is simply the speed with which the body moves in the circular path. More systematically, it is the <span style="color:#00b050;">ratio</span> of <span style="color:#0070c0;">angular displacement</span> to the <span style="color:#0070c0;">time</span> taken by it to cover the distance.

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Time period and Frequency**</span>

_<span style="color:#7030a0;">**Time period**</span> is the time taken by the body in circular motion to complete one revolution_. It is denoted by (**T**). In a complete revolution it covers 2π radians. Thus the angular velocity is

_<span style="color:#7030a0;">**Frequency**</span> is the number of **revolutions per second**_. It is denoted by **ν** (Greek letter Nu)

From the above equations we can say that

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Kinematical equations of circular motion**</span>

The basic equations of motion can be rewritten as follows

<span style="color:red;font-size:12pt;">**Equation 1**</span>

Where **α** is the **angular acceleration**

<span style="color:red;font-size:12pt;">**Equation 2**</span>

<span style="color:red;font-size:12pt;">**Equation 3**</span>

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Uniform circular motion**</span>

_When a body moves in a circular path of fixed radius at a constant speed, then the motion of that object is called a **uniform circular motion**._

{% include image.html url="http://phisyks.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/092515_1038_circularmot11.png" description="" %}

During a uniform circular motion, the direction of the velocity vector changes continuously. But according to Newton's laws of motion there must be an external force to change the direction of motion.

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Centripetal force**</span>

This force plays the role of that external force responsible for the change of direction of motion in a uniform circular motion.

As a result of this force there is an acceleration called centripetal acceleration directed towards the center of the circular path

The centripetal force is given by

Further it can be written as

**Real life example:**

Consider a merry go round with a mass of 50 kg kept on the blue position and revolving in an anticlockwise direction with velocity **v**. Then the force experienced by the mass is given by

<span style="font-size:16pt;">**Centrifugal force**</span>

The outward force experienced by an object in circular motion is called centrifugal force.

**_Note: Centrifugal force is not a real force_**

It is given by

It can be studied in terms of inertia but still inertia is not the actual cause of it. Below is an animation of a body in uniform circular motion.
