#Friction

"Friction is a necessary evil" – A very famous quote

Friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object that is in contact with another body. The contact is important, since friction is a contact force.

The cause of friction is a combination of several surface phenomena including irregularities in surfaces, Electrostatic force of attraction etc.

Frictional force are of 2 types:
<ul>
	<li>Static friction</li>
	<li>Kinetic friction</li>
</ul>

The friction that keeps the body in rest even if enough force is applied. This force has a limit. This limit is called the <strong>Maximum static friction</strong> or the <strong>limiting friction.
</strong>

<strong>The formula for limiting static friction is:

</sub>

Where N is the normal reaction on the body and µ<sub>s</sub> is the coefficient of static friction.

&nbsp;

Where α is the angle of the inclined plane. Now the value of friction for different situations is as follows
<ul>
	<li>
<div>When the body is in rest</div>
&nbsp;

<strong>f<sub>s </sub>= mg x sin (α)
</strong>

&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
<div>The maximum static friction or the limiting friction is</div>
&nbsp;

<strong>f<sub>max</sub> = µ<sub>s</sub> x N
</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kinetic friction: </strong></span>

When the body starts to slide down the inclined plane the <strong>kinetic friction</strong> acting on the body is given by

</strong>

<strong>These are the general properties of friction.
